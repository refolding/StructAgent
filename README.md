This release contains two usable layers:

1. **Complete agent system** — an Annika/Maria/A2A architecture for separating scientific reasoning from execution control.
2. **Skills-only mode** — install the released skill protocols into any compatible OpenClaw-style agent and use them without running the full multi-agent system.

The public repository intentionally excludes private identities, tokens, chat routing configuration, raw session logs, and example structural datasets. Reviewer-only evidence bundles are tracked separately.

## Quick start

### Option A — use only the skills

Copy selected folders under `skills/annika/` or `skills/maria/` into your agent's `skills/` directory, restart/rescan the agent, then invoke tasks that match the skill names.

See [`docs/skills_only_usage.md`](docs/skills_only_usage.md). For a worked Claude/Codex-style implementation example, see [`docs/cryosparc_skill_example/`](docs/cryosparc_skill_example/).

### Option B — implement the full StructAgent system

Create two agents:

- **Maria** — domain reasoning, paper reading, literature/database synthesis, scientific critique.
- **Annika** — structural-biology execution, tool orchestration, run logging, metric capture, recovery.

Connect them with an A2A JSON-RPC gateway or equivalent message bus. Use the templates in `scripts/` and the protocol in `architecture/collaboration_protocol.md`.

See [`docs/full_system_implementation.md`](docs/full_system_implementation.md).

## Changelog

### v3 (2026-05-22)
- **Added** `skills/annika/cryosparc/` — self-contained, unofficial cryoSPARC SPA advisor/automation skill covering import, preprocessing, picking, 2D/3D workflows, refinement, 3DVA/3DFlex, masks, helical processing, CryoSPARC Live, `cryosparc-tools`, `cryosparcm`, GPU lanes/queues, storage, RELION interop, troubleshooting, and error lookup. Includes synthesized workflow references and a dry-run-first `scripts/cryosparc_harness.py` helper for cautious local automation.
- **Added** `docs/cryosparc_skill_example/` — sanitized public usage page showing the unofficial AI agent skill for cryoSPARC as a Claude/Codex-style implementation pattern that can also be adapted to other agent runtimes.

### v2 (2026-05-18)
- **Added** `skills/annika/emerald/` — Rosetta EMERALD ligand docking into cryo-EM density maps (GALigandDock + density-weighted scoring). Includes wrapper scripts, presets, CLI reference, and installation guide.
- **Added** `skills/annika/annika-log/` — auditable project/job folder discipline. Provides canonical logging layout, error/lesson export for Supp. Table 3, integrity auditing, and paper-traceability mapping.
- Updated repository layout documentation.

### v1 (2025-05-18)
- Initial release with core structural-biology skills (ChimeraX, Coot, CCP4, ISOLDE, Phenix, structural-strategy, structural_build) and literature skills (database, discovery, distill, paper-reader, review-paper).

## Status

Active development. The software/protocol release is present and expanding as new tool integrations are validated. Paper-submission readiness depends on completing the confidential reviewer evidence bundle.
