This release contains two usable layers:

1. **Complete agent system** — an Annika/Maria/A2A architecture for separating scientific reasoning from execution control.
2. **Skills-only mode** — install the released skill protocols into any compatible OpenClaw-style agent and use them without running the full multi-agent system.

The public repository intentionally excludes private identities, tokens, chat routing configuration, raw session logs, and example structural datasets. Reviewer-only evidence bundles are tracked separately.

## Quick start

### Option A — use only the skills

Copy selected folders under `skills/annika/` or `skills/maria/` into your agent's `skills/` directory, restart/rescan the agent, then invoke tasks that match the skill names.

See [`docs/skills_only_usage.md`](docs/skills_only_usage.md). For a worked Claude/Codex-style implementation example, see [`docs/cryosparc_skill_example/`](docs/cryosparc_skill_example/).

### Option B — implement the full StructAgent system

Create two agents:

- **Maria** — domain reasoning, paper reading, literature/database synthesis, scientific critique.
- **Annika** — structural-biology execution, tool orchestration, run logging, metric capture, recovery.

Connect them with an A2A JSON-RPC gateway or equivalent message bus. Use the templates in `scripts/` and the protocol in `architecture/collaboration_protocol.md`.

See [`docs/full_system_implementation.md`](docs/full_system_implementation.md). Optional public PDB/PDBe lookup tools can be exposed via [`docs/pdbe_mcp_setup.md`](docs/pdbe_mcp_setup.md).

## Changelog

### v12 (2026-06-18)
- **Fixed** `skills/annika/cryosparc/scripts/roundtrip/` so per-class cryoSPARC subset refines force a fresh balanced gold-standard split by default (`force_gs_resplit: true`), preventing inherited imbalanced consensus splits from silently culling particles.
- **Added** a `cs_roundtrip.py verify` post-run check for subset-refine particle retention and `alignments3D/split` balance, with updated round-trip docs and config template.

### v11 (2026-06-11)
- **Updated** `skills/annika/cryosparc/` with a crYOLO general-model picking → cryoSPARC Extract/2D overlay: new `29_cryolo_picking_to_2d.md` workflow page plus the config-driven `scripts/cryolo_pick/` bundle for external-job pick injection, extraction, Y-flip verification, 2D classification, and optimization.
- **Updated** `skills/annika/cryolo-skill/` with the reciprocal crYOLO-side workflow reference `references/11_cryosparc_picking_workflow.md`, covering filter-matched general models, box sizing, CBOX re-thresholding, and hand-off to the cryoSPARC automation bundle.

### v10 (2026-06-09)
- **Updated** `skills/annika/cryosparc/` with a cryoSPARC ⇄ RELION focused-3D-classification round-trip add-on: new `28_relion_class3d_roundtrip.md` workflow page plus config-driven `scripts/roundtrip/` bundle for uid-preserving class split/re-refinement.
- **Updated** `skills/annika/relion/` with the reciprocal cross-link to the cryoSPARC-owned round-trip workflow.
- **Added** `skills/annika/cryosparc/references/29_external_tool_bridge_format.md` — a hub/spoke adapter manifest for future cryoSPARC-orchestrated crYOLO, cryoDRGN, RELION, or other external-tool integrations while keeping each tool skill independently usable. Cross-linked from crYOLO/cryoDRGN interop references.

### v9 (2026-06-07)
- **Added** `skills/annika/deepemhancer-skill/` — config-first DeepEMhancer post-processing skill with environment probing, confirmation-gated install/model-download/run scripts, and static packaging validator; local/private config outputs are intentionally not bundled.
- **Updated** `skills/annika/cryolo-skill/`, `skills/annika/cryodrgn-skill/`, and `skills/annika/topaz-skill/` frontmatter descriptions to mark the live-validated, ready-to-use release status.

### v8 (2026-06-06)
- **Added** `skills/annika/cryolo-skill/` — config-first crYOLO particle-picking skill validated against crYOLO 1.9.9 on a Linux + NVIDIA host; local/private probe outputs are intentionally not bundled.
- **Added** `skills/annika/cryodrgn-skill/` — config-first cryoDRGN heterogeneity reconstruction skill validated against cryoDRGN 4.2.1 on a Linux + NVIDIA host; local/private probe outputs are intentionally not bundled.
- **Updated** `skills/annika/topaz-skill/` — rewritten/validated against Topaz 0.3.20 with live help + GPU smoke evidence; local/private probe outputs remain excluded.

### v7 (2026-06-05)
- **Added** `skills/annika/topaz-skill/` — config-first, source-grounded Topaz skill for particle picking, denoising, coordinate conversion, install/device guidance, and safe placeholder workflow templates. Local probe outputs (`configs/site_config.local.*`) are intentionally not bundled.

### v6 (2026-06-04)
- **Added** `skills/annika/relion/` — RELION 5 workflow skill covering STAR metadata, project/job trees, preprocessing, picking/extraction, 2D/3D classification/refinement, masks/postprocessing/local resolution, polishing, tomography, schemes, interop, and troubleshooting.

### v5 (2026-06-04)
- **Added** `skills/annika/mask/` — standalone headless ChimeraX mask-generation skill for model-reference (`molmap`) and map-threshold mask bases, including CryoSPARC handoff guidance, helper scripts, and compact original references. The raw upstream tutorial transcript from the local source folder is intentionally not bundled.

### v4 (2026-05-29)
- **Updated** `skills/annika/cryosparc/` to the current v5.0.6-aware skill bundle, including expanded SPA playbooks, case-study/tutorial routing, integrated ChimeraX mask-generation guidance, small mask assets, and file-local mask helper scripts under `scripts/masks/`.
- **Added** `docs/pdbe_mcp_setup.md` — optional PDBe API/Search MCP configuration for StructAgent-style Maria/Annika deployments using `pdbe-mcp-server --transport stdio`; graph server remains out of scope unless a local PDBe-KB Neo4j deployment is provided.

### v3 (2026-05-22)
- **Added** `skills/annika/cryosparc/` — self-contained, unofficial cryoSPARC SPA advisor/automation skill covering import, preprocessing, picking, 2D/3D workflows, refinement, 3DVA/3DFlex, masks, helical processing, CryoSPARC Live, `cryosparc-tools`, `cryosparcm`, GPU lanes/queues, storage, RELION interop, troubleshooting, and error lookup. Includes synthesized workflow references and a dry-run-first `scripts/cryosparc_harness.py` helper for cautious local automation.
- **Added** `docs/cryosparc_skill_example/` — sanitized public usage page showing the unofficial AI agent skill for cryoSPARC as a Claude/Codex-style implementation pattern that can also be adapted to other agent runtimes.

### v2 (2026-05-18)
- **Added** `skills/annika/emerald/` — Rosetta EMERALD ligand docking into cryo-EM density maps (GALigandDock + density-weighted scoring). Includes wrapper scripts, presets, CLI reference, and installation guide.
- **Added** `skills/annika/annika-log/` — auditable project/job folder discipline. Provides canonical logging layout, error/lesson export for Supp. Table 3, integrity auditing, and paper-traceability mapping.
- Updated repository layout documentation.

### v1 (2025-05-18)
- Initial release with core structural-biology skills (ChimeraX, Coot, CCP4, ISOLDE, Phenix, structural-strategy, structural_build) and literature skills (database, discovery, distill, paper-reader, review-paper).

## Status

Active development. The software/protocol release is present and expanding as new tool integrations are validated. Paper-submission readiness depends on completing the confidential reviewer evidence bundle.
